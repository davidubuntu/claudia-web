  description:
    Ashtanga yoga and teahouse for the "YOGI TEA" brand. The concept is creating a space of coexistence for yoga lovers, where they live their passion and then read in the library area sharing their experiences while having a cup of tea.

    The design of the space aims the user to stop breathing and observe himself. It's a space created for daily work in oneself, growth and calm.Access through a reception and information point and a small tea store, mats and accessories for practice. Textiles are elements which hang generating theatricality in space and enhancing the great height of the ceilings.

    Three arches open different paths to a more private lobby area, this space is created so that users can leave their belongings and change.The singularity of the building is made up of a very long rectangular space, which allows us to divide it into two, the shala where yoga is practiced and, on the other hand, the tearoom, a patio, the bathrooms and changing rooms and the private store and kitchen for the staff.
