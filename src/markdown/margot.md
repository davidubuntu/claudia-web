  type: residential
  place: Madrid
  description: 
    The ‘Madrid de los Austrias’, with the Almudena Cathedral and the Royal Palace host this family home where one drinks in the flavor of the old capital.
    
    The sobriety of geometric shapes with rough walls alongside translucent ones produces serenity. It is a harmonious place. Geometry and light have been the sources of inspiration for Margot. Relationships are created between the inhabited spaces and the volume of the house.

    The project prioritizes family life and comfort on the ground floor of the house and ergonomics in the office area located on the top floor. A hollow volume is created in the building that allows to gain height in this area intended for common use. This volume is enveloped by a translucent polycarbonate skin built with a series of white profiles generating a longitudinal rhythm.
