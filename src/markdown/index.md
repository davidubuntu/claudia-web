  title: MY SKILLS
  description:
    I a am currently working as an interior designer at DOCRYS&DC studio. My work is both as a commercial and project designer, and I am involved in the project from start to finish, from first data collection with the client, (creative design process, logistics, material orders, execution on-site...) until its completion.

    I am good at plans and layouts, infographics, capturing client's requirements, giving creative solutions, and conceptualizing projects. I like to work with technology but I am also proficient with more organic techniques like drawing and "collage".
    
    On a personal note, I love to practice Asthanga yoga and to cook plant-based food!
