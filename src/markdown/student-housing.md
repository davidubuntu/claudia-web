  description: 
    The resurgence of a new life from previous existence is the inspiration for rehabilitating a building as unique as the Jesuit Council Seminary in Segovia.

    The proposition is to give it a new use by housing a student residence. The building and its uniqueness are to be respected, updating its spatial organization and creating a new coexistence model which aims to break with the current one. Thus, a new experience of coexistence is created, where a tendency towards socialization and habitability naturally generates.
    
    Two housing models. Individual spaces, colonizing the corridors that surround the central patio and using the height and the special lenses to let in light. On the other hand, the Box room, where students will have his / her bedroom along with their personal belongings, while the rest of the activities will be carried out in the common areas.
