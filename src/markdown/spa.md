  description: 
    The geometric cuts in view of an abandoned quarry and the force of water as an element of wear are the radical inspiration for this project. Silence, calmness, water, sounds or caves are some of the themes behind this Cvalia design.

    The intention is to transmit sensations and experiences through spaces that evoke contact with natural stone in a relaxing environment for the visitor. In the Spa, a dance between straight and oblique volumes that project in different directions is observed, causing verticality to be lost as a result of the inclined direction of its edges.

    A variety of cavities are created where the temperature contrast bathtubs are arranged. The stone floor of the Spa rises, generating more depth. The materials used are white limestone, wood with special anti-humidity treatment and green steel.
