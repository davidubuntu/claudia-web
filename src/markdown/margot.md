  description: Irony, humor and some eroticism are the concepts behind Marcel Wanders most recent project. An indulgent luxury hotel where guests are rejuvenated through a pampered recreation of new Iberostar Grand Hotel Portals Nous in Mallorca. Located on a magnificent beach, this luxurious design uses transparencies, whites and reflective surfaces to create a flow of openness. Emphasizing craft and modern design, the Mallorquin style is reinforced, inspiring guests with the scenery of Spain.
