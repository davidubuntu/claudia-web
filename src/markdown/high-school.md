    CESD CENTRO DE EDUCACION SECUNDARIA DISRUPTIVA EL CESDÂ 
    
    The Disruptive Secondary Education Center is a public center, which includes the Compulsory Secondary Education cycles.

    The intervention carried out is intended to be a response to the deficiencies that we find today in this type of center.

    This project focuses on the students, being aware of their needs as per their age range and using the space as a third educator. A transformative attitude has been adopted, based on objective and real aspects, for an integral development of a person within an educational center.

    It is a speculative and experimental project, which follows research on different fields related to pedagogy, design, architecture and psychology.
