  description:
    Dynamism and flexibility are the precursor elements for the creation of this space. Inspired by the bases of Ashtanga Yoga, a space is created where lovers of this ancient practice coexist for their spiritual development. Meditation, rest and reading are accompanied by tea at the end of the practice.
    
    The aim of the design of this space is for the user to stop to breathe and observe himself. Daily work towards oneself is promoted, for growth and for the search for inner peace.
    The entrance, with a brutalist ascetic and an out of scale proportion, with cement as the main material are the motivation for the user's mental focus in this space. A reception hosts a store for teas, mats and other yoga accessories. Textiles hang from the ceiling adding in theatrical elements to the space, enhancing its height.
    Three arches open different paths to a more intimate lobby area, where users can leave their belongings and change.
    
    What makes the building special is that it is made up of a very long rectangular space, which can be divided into two sections, the shala where yoga is practiced and, on the other hand, the tearoom, a patio, the bathrooms and changing rooms as well as the storage / kitchen for the staff.
