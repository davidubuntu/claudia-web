  description: 
    In the heart of Madrid, a beautiful home is presented for a Danish couple who are lovers of design and with a daring taste for color, which is the main element is shown throughout the entire house.

    We find two different spaces based on polarity, external and internal, public and private, common and intimate.
    The entrance leads us directly to the open kitchen, in natural walnut veneer that is combined with a 6 cm thick stone workbench. The open living room integrates the kitchen, respecting the structural features of the house by pillars bare, with a certain rhythm and visual partition of the spaces.
    
    Two large windows, that give us the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, are the main source of natural lighting in the house.
    The bedroom is separated from the main bathroom by a translucent vertical facing that allows for a glimpse and semi-integration of the two environments, generating spaciousness and light.
